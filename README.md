# Simplebuzz (previously known as "Nerdquiz")
Simple Buzzer software written in C# (Unity2D)

This is currently a very quick and dirty hack (I had to get it done in a very short time)
Will be completely rewritten!

Features:
- Runs on PC (Windows), Mac and Linux (should also run via HTML5 an any other Platform using Unity2D)
- 4 Player
- Use any Input as Buzzer (including Buzz!-Buzzers)
- integrated 20 seconds timer
- after buzzing it will show the scores + you can change the score fr every player (-1, +1 , +3 and +5 Points)

Planned Features:
- Read questions from text files
- Two types of question (pick A/B/C/D, free answer)
- optional auto add points
- Change number of players
- Change Player names
- Sfx
- Change Input at runtime

Known Bugs:
- Window and fullscreen resolution must be at least 1280x720px, or "Continue" Button won't appear
- To restart the timer, someone has to buzz
- also you can't hide the timer
